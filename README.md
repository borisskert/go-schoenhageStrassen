# go-Schönhage-Strassen

## What is this?

This is a Go implementation of the Schönhage-Strassen algorithm for multiplying large integers. The algorithm is
described in the paper "Schnelle Multiplikation großer Zahlen" by Arnold Schönhage and Volker Strassen.

## Why?

I wanted to learn more about the Schönhage-Strassen algorithm and thought that implementing it would be a good way to
do so.
